# Smart Cart

This is a prototype of our 36 hours hackthon project aiming at improving the shopping experience in a supermarket.

## Features

	1. Detect articles in your cart. This is currently done with barcode but we aim at using computer vision / image recognition to do it to avoid adding a new step in the buying process for the customer.

	2. Checking that the added product match the customer's diet (vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, lactose free) and warn him if it's not the case.

	3. Make product recommendation based on what is already in the cart. For example, based on the ingredient you already bought, we match existing recipes and give you the list of missing articles.

	4. Request a missing article in the supermarket (in case the shelf is empty). If the product is in stock, an employee will bring it to you. In the meantime, you keep shopping.

We had quite a few more ideas, but unfortunately we haven't found time to implement them :-)

## Tech

We used [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) to build the mobile app. It's really easy to create an hybrid app which will work on Android and iOS.

## Team

Bruno, Leo, VJ, Moises and me.
